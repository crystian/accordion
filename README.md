# Web component: Accordion

This is a simple accordion component to use on your project as a dependency (work in progress).

You can test it cloning this repo and playing with the "custom" client.

## Features
* Can read elements from current DOM (HTML fixed)
* Can add and remove an element dynamically
* Customize the component with your styles
* It uses web component so that you can extend or use as a standard HTML element
* Auto collapsible content (or do not) by click
* Accessibility compatible (WIP)
* A playground to play with the component and its properties! 

* Technical: ES6, Test (30+-), Coverage (100%), Sass, Linter, Normalize.css

**Note:** No compatible with old browsers.  

## Scripts for collaborators:
* `npm i`
* `npm start` Launch a server with hot-reload on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  
* `npm test` Launch the test with jasmine (`*.spec.js` files)  
* `npm run build` Build the application for publish in `dist` folder  
* `npm run coverage` Launch the test with coverage report.  
* `npm run lint` Launch linter for code style.

## TODO
* Change the element DL to UL/LI
* Use a simple node with content (LI)
* Prepare as npm dependency
